# Project Context

## 0. Meta-Protocol Principles

- `Mobile companion boundary`: Telegram extends a running Pi session; it is not a remote terminal, PTY supervisor, process launcher, session browser, or replacement TUI. Never emulate Pi navigation through private internals, ANSI/TTY injection, or a shadow `pi` process. An operator-visible exception is the explicit new-thread request: when the owner creates a fresh Telegram thread and prompts in it, the leader may spawn a visible background `pi --mode rpc` instance bound to that thread (logged under `tmp/telegram/spawn-*.log`), never an invisible process.
- `Runtime safety`: Prefer explicit, fenced, recoverable behavior over shortcuts that can desynchronize Telegram transport, durable admission, local queue state, or Pi lifecycle state.
- `Pi-native extensibility`: Add capabilities through stable Pi and pi-telegram contracts. Do not fork polling, transport, menu ownership, or package-private runtime internals.
- `Bidirectional binding`: Treat Pi instance ↔ Telegram thread and bot ↔ client state as two-way relationships. Create, observe, repair, and reflect bindings on both surfaces.
- `Progressive enhancement`: Use richer Telegram/Pi capability when proven available and retain a useful fail-closed fallback when it is not.
- `Boundary clarity`: Keep Telegram transport, Pi integration, rendering/delivery, durable admission, extension APIs, and release/context state under distinct owners.

## 1. Product Contract

`pi-telegram` is a session-local Telegram runtime adapter for Pi: a private-DM operator surface for prompts, streaming previews, queue controls, settings, files, voice/buttons, and companion-extension interop. Its core loop is mobile continuation of a live Pi session.

Canonical terms:

- `Telegram turn`: One Telegram input unit processed by Pi, including a coalesced media group.
- `Queued` / `active Telegram turn`: Accepted-but-not-running / currently bound Pi work.
- `TelegramTarget`: `{ chatId, threadId? }`; classic private chats omit `threadId`.
- `Thread`: Product term for Telegram's tabbed private-chat surface. Use `topic` only for Bot API primitives.
- `Leader` / `follower`: The process owning `getUpdates` and direct Bot API transport / a registered process routing through that leader.
- `Instance slot`: Extension-owned `A`–`Z` ordering metadata, not the normal visible thread title. Naming and allocation details live in [`docs/multi-instance-bus.md`](./docs/multi-instance-bus.md).

## 2. Context Ownership

Keep each fact in one authoritative layer:

- [`README.md`](./README.md): Public product entrypoint. Preserve the flow identity → install/connect → examples → product model → compact capabilities → controls/safety → docs. Balance strong positioning with a practical catalogue; neither hide capabilities nor duplicate implementation docs.
- `AGENTS.md`: Stable engineering boundaries, recurring runtime invariants, and work protocol. Link to evolving subsystem contracts instead of copying them here.
- [`BACKLOG.md`](./BACKLOG.md): Canonical unresolved work. Keep only open top-level outcomes with nested decomposition and done criteria. Remove completed outcomes rather than retaining checked history.
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md): Completed user/operator/developer impact. A release has at most eight outcome bullets of at most 512 characters, each beginning with an inline-code domain label and colon. Exclude personal names and real user/chat/message/thread identifiers. Consolidate the current pre-release section before release; do not rewrite historical sections without an explicit retrospective request and evidence pass.
- [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md): Technical documentation index.
- [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md): Canonical runtime, domain-ownership, queue, journal, delivery, and lifecycle contract.
- [`docs/public-api.md`](./docs/public-api.md): Canonical public commands, config, markup, package entrypoints, and compatibility contract.
- [`docs/multi-instance-bus.md`](./docs/multi-instance-bus.md): Canonical Threaded Mode, leader/follower, binding, election, and transport protocol.
- Other `/docs` files own their named subsystem contracts; keep them reachable from `docs/README.md`.

## 3. Repository Topology And Local Skills

- `/index.ts`: Sole extension entrypoint and composition root.
- `/api/*.ts`: Stable public package membranes documented in `docs/public-api.md`.
- `/lib/*.ts`: Flat, cohesive runtime domains; package-private unless re-exported through `/api`.
- `/tests/*.test.ts`: Domain-mirrored suites; `tests/integration.test.ts` owns cross-domain runtime flows.
- `/skills/telegram-bridge`: Stable agent operating protocol for Telegram turns, delivery, actions, Threaded Mode, and diagnosis.
- `/skills/generated-control-surface`: Optional state-derived, late-bound interface over truthful domain evidence, capabilities, workflows, and choices; it remains renderer-neutral, independent from the bridge skill, and owns no parallel state.
- `/skills/generative-apps`: Agent operating contract for compiling stable repeated Telegram interaction into deterministic standalone applications or bounded view/controller adapters whose buttons bypass model inference.
- `/.agents/skills/telegram-bot`: Bot API lookup guidance and vendored `api.md`; keep the reference intact.
- `/.agents/skills/domain-dag`: Repository architecture guidance and validator.

Use the relevant local skill before non-trivial work in its domain. Keep skill operating guidance in its `SKILL.md`, not duplicated here.

## 4. Architecture And Runtime Invariants

### 4.1 Flat Domain DAG

- Cohesive domains live as flat `/lib/*.ts` modules whose local import graph is acyclic.
- `index.ts` constructs high-level runtimes and wires live ports. Domain policy, mutable state, sequencing, identity, retries, normalization, and lifecycle recovery belong to the owning `/lib` module.
- Extract only when ownership, substitution, independent testing/mutation, cycle pressure, or repeated coupling earns a boundary. Do not atomize a cohesive module or create one-use wrappers merely to shrink `index.ts`.
- `bindings` owns Pi-facing registration and narrow cross-domain assembly; it may connect established ports but must not absorb routing, rendering, transport, or mutable policy.
- `pi` owns direct Pi SDK imports and concrete adapter contracts. Other domains use narrow ports; domains that register Pi hooks/tools/commands consume contracts through that adapter.
- Do not introduce shared buckets such as `lib/constants.ts`, `lib/types.ts`, `lib/globals.ts`, or broad global-augmentation modules. Keep state, constants, registry keys, and concrete transport shapes with their domain owner.
- Every source `.ts` file starts with a brief responsibility header containing `Zones:` tags such as `telegram`, `pi agent`, `tui`, or `shared utils`.
- Use namespace imports for local domains in `index.ts` (`Queue.*`, `Turns.*`) and keep direct `node:*`, filesystem, process, and local-adapter mechanics in owning domains when one exists.

### 4.2 Ownership, Sessions, And Trust

- The bridge is session-local and paired to one allowed Telegram user. Preserve `{ chatId, threadId? }` through every inbound, queue, callback, reaction, media, preview, reply, menu, voice, attachment, and direct-delivery path.
- Telegram transport ownership is not semantic queue ownership. Losing the exact transport lock must not erase accepted local queue work or stop valid local Pi dispatch; direct Bot API mutations fail closed until exact direct or follower authority exists.
- `tmp/telegram/owners.json` is the sole transport-owner authority. Cross-process read/check/write operations serialize transactionally and acquisition, refresh, release, takeover, and irreversible leader work fence the exact owner/epoch. `state.json` and `logs.jsonl` are diagnostics, never routing authority.
- Threaded Mode has exactly one live leader per bot profile. Followers are real operator-started Pi processes and must authenticate/register over local IPC; Telegram never spawns hidden Pi processes. The one explicit exception is a new-thread instance request: the owner creating a fresh thread and prompting in it authorizes the leader to spawn a visible background `pi --mode rpc` follower bound to that thread, carrying an exact `TELEGRAM_FOLLOWER_TARGET_*` binding; such instances register through the same local IPC admission and remain visible, logged, and bounded. A live but unreachable owner does not authorize split-brain polling.
- Local IPC is a trust boundary, not merely a private socket. Unknown, stale, mismatched-generation, or unauthorized requests must not inject prompts, callbacks, API sends, artifacts, liveness, or bindings.
- Protocol compatibility is independent from package version. Registration negotiates protocol version, runtime build, and canonical capabilities before target provisioning or live publication. `durable-follower-admission-v1` gates source forwarding; `queue-handoff-v1` independently gates semantic queue transfer for every participant and is advertised only with exact source/recipient journal-binding composition. `follower.register` is the sole bootstrap request; other requests require exact live-registry generation authority, and `bus.ack` is response-only.
- Long-lived timers, pollers, watchers, receivers, heartbeats, background delivery, and deferred dispatch are session-bound. Replacement stops stale activity and makes late work inert; same-process handoff may preserve exact profile/target identity but never stale Pi context or cross-profile authority. Aborting a durable update generation does not release that `update_id`: replacement replay waits for its actual handler settlement, and effectful handlers use the shared execution fence immediately before commit and after awaited delegation. Internal clones explicitly carry the hidden fence; reroute forwarding, thread-store mutation, cleanup, and Bot API boundaries retain the originating generation.
- Runtime state is event-driven reconciliation of local assumptions against Telegram signals, not a complete bot read-model and not permission to query Telegram on every action. Destructive thread cleanup goes through `thread-reconciler` with current proof and leader fencing.

### 4.3 Durable Admission And Settlement

- Admission is journal-first: validate and persist the complete `getUpdates` response before one monotonic offset commit, then signal an independent worker without awaiting semantic execution. Missing cursor with a non-empty journal, malformed/foreign authority, or capacity exhaustion fails closed. “Durable” means process-crash recovery after atomic rename, not unflushed host/kernel/filesystem/device/power-loss survival.
- Foreign forwarding settles as `accepted`, `retryable`, or `terminal-rejected`. Only an authenticated acknowledgement carrying the expected `deliveryId` and `sourceUpdateId` releases leader journal authority. Negative, missing, stale, mismatched, or capacity-failed settlement remains durable; callback error answers are side effects only.
- A forwarding delivery id is stable across registration replacement and derives from envelope kind, source `update_id`, and stable recipient binding. Runtime instance and registration generation remain separate attempt fences. Persisted message ownership carries the stable binding so replay can rebind only to its current authenticated registration.
- A queued receipt persists its acquiring runtime instance, OS pid/process-birth identity, session generation, acquisition id, and acquisition time. Only exact authority may settle or discard it. Same-process session replacement may reconstruct the claim and the original process may settle after transport ownership moves; a foreign process may neither replay nor settle it through generic removal or a copied acquisition id.
- Startup and elapsed time are not owner-death proof; queued authority has no time lease. Dead-owner cleanup groups the complete receipt and transactionally rechecks pid liveness plus process-birth identity: only an absent PID or mismatched stable Linux/macOS birth proof discards all session-owned sources without replay; a matching proof is `alive`, while Windows or inaccessible birth metadata is `unverifiable`, and both non-dead outcomes keep authority queued. The live-transfer contract is authenticated offer → exact-generation bounded payload staging → recipient CAS acceptance → exact receipt-and-owner ACK → donor removal → recipient readiness. The offer freezes donor settlement/recovery; controls rebuild local closures; negative/mismatched pre-acceptance ACK cancels only an unaccepted offer and retains donor work; a lost post-acceptance ACK cannot cancel recipient authority and leaves donor memory frozen for explicit reconciliation.
- Execution failures persist bounded diagnostics and attempt state as `retry-wait`, except that an exact Telegram HTTP 400 stale/deleted-thread API failure with a proven `{chatId, threadId}` terminally settles the currently executing source after best-effort shared binding invalidation. Automatic retry continues indefinitely with exponential `1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 60s` delay capped at 60 seconds; later independent updates continue draining, durable authority is never silently discarded, and legacy `failed` entries resume automatically at startup. Snapshot-plus-segment journals compact only after 256 unapplied revisions or 4 MiB; snapshot-first cleanup tolerates redundant segments, and empty authority may atomically rebind bot/profile identity. Missing snapshots left by the retired broad temp cleanup rebuild only from a complete provably empty segment chain, while revisionless snapshots may recover from a validated later segment predecessor; otherwise the snapshot and segments move atomically under `tmp/telegram/recovery/` before a fresh journal is published and startup continues with informational recovery evidence.
- An unresolved reaction delays only the exact governed queue item identified by chat/message sources, not unrelated queue work. Queue receipt publication follows in-memory append and precedes dispatch request; receipt-bearing turns remain queued until every exact source commits.
- The detailed implementation and release gates live in [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md), [`docs/multi-instance-bus.md`](./docs/multi-instance-bus.md), and [`BACKLOG.md`](./BACKLOG.md).

### 4.4 Queue, Delivery, And User Surfaces

- Queue lane/kind admission is explicit. Dispatch waits for active-turn, pending-dispatch, control, compaction, `ctx.isIdle()`, and Pi pending-message guards; a dispatched prompt stays queued until `agent_start` consumes it. Each prompt is one object with one active lane and no reserved return slot. Normal and Priority are separate FIFO lanes: crossing lanes removes it from the source and appends it at the destination tail, while Keep/Skip and same-category emoji changes preserve lane position. Complete reaction sets independently derive Priority from recognized positive emoji and Skip from recognized negative emoji; both may coexist, suppressed turns retain durable receipts while waiting, and Skip settles them only when the prompt reaches dispatch before dropping it without inference. Suppressed turns remain visible at a struck-through physical ordinal without contributing to executable queue counters, while graceful session shutdown discards all remaining queue authority before clearing memory.
- `/stop`, `/abort`, `/next`, and `/continue` respectively reset+abort, abort while preserving queue, force the next turn, and enqueue a control-lane continuation. Abort-history folding applies only to Telegram-owned active turns.
- Telegram extension side effects must not hold Pi's core lifecycle hostage after semantic completion. Preserve ordering in extension-owned background work, record failures, and fence target/profile/transport/session authority.
- Complete assistant/guest model answers use Telegram-native Rich Markdown. Harness-owned menus, status, diagnostics, thinking, and tool evidence remain explicit HTML/plain or their documented native surface. Before Telegram preview or final delivery, strip every assistant-authored HTML comment regardless of Markdown position while keeping action activation top-level-only; a comment-only result sends no text message. Preserve literal code outside comments and structurally safe chunking; never split invalid markup.
- `preview` owns streaming lifecycle only, not assistant rendering. Finalization waits for active preview flushes and must not issue pre/post-final draft-clear calls that create transient Telegram draft UI.
- Native `sendChatAction(typing)` is the automatic activity signal for unsettled agent and compaction work while Telegram transport is authorized. Extension-owned blocking UI prompts pause it and completion resumes it while either work owner remains active. Do not invent extra in-chat work indicators or emit activity for startup/connect/reload/recovery alone.
- Public activity handlers and connected companion delivery are asynchronous, target-bound, generation-fenced surfaces. Connected companion projection has no independent opt-out: disconnect or authority loss is its boundary. Token deltas, hidden reasoning, unknown sources, and stale authority never enter public projection.
- UI labels, emoji semantics, navigation, settings controls, callback namespaces, voice behavior, command templates, and assistant markup follow the linked `/docs` contracts. Generated human-readable prompt-button labels use `emoji + space + text`; emoji-free text is only a reasoned no-semantic-marker fallback. Non-spatial generated controls default to top-level vertical cells, with nested rows reserved for unmistakably compact peers. Do not restate other evolving UI details here.

## 5. Domain Ownership Index

The detailed map is canonical in [`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md). This index is only for routing work:

- `queue`, `runtime`, `lifecycle`, `locks`: Scheduling, session coordination, lifecycle, and locking.
- `api`, `polling`, `bus*`, `ownership`, `target`, `sync`, `thread-reconciler`, `threads`, `updates`, `routing`, `media`, `turns`, `inbound`, `config`, `setup`: Telegram transport, profiles, durable admission, routing, and inbound flow.
- `preview`, `replies`, `rendering`, `keyboard`, `delivery`, `activity`, `outbound*`, `voice`, `status`: Response and delivery surfaces.
- `commands`, `menu*`, `model`, `prompts`: Controls and application-menu UI; core queue mechanics remain in `queue`.
- `sections`, `delivery`, `activity`, `voice`: Extension registries/runtime membranes for their named capabilities. `Companion` describes consumers, not a source-domain owner.
- `pi`, `bindings`: Pi SDK boundary and Pi-facing registration/composition.

## 6. Public And Integration Boundaries

- Companion extensions use documented package subpaths such as `@llblab/pi-telegram/sections`, `/delivery`, `/voice`, `/inbound`, `/outbound`, and `/updates`; never import `lib/*.ts`.
- Low-level handler buses have no caller-supplied ids; high-level registries use stable identities. Imperative delivery resolves the current runtime on every call and returns generation-bound logical handles rather than captured Pi contexts.
- Extension sections receive only documented context ports. They do not access raw bot clients/filesystems or run a second polling loop; unregister on shutdown.
- Unknown callback data may reach extension handlers only after built-in namespaces decline it. Follow [`docs/callback-namespaces.md`](./docs/callback-namespaces.md).
- Command templates remain compact and shell-free. Use string leaves or ordered `template` arrays; shell operators are not an execution contract. Examples use portable executable placeholders, never machine-local paths.
- `telegram_attach` is the canonical file path and `telegram_message` the direct Markdown text/buttons path. Both require current direct or registered-follower authority and must not replace the normal active-turn reply.
- Inbound handlers transform text/media before queueing; outbound handlers precede programmatic/provider fallbacks. Public contracts and ordering live in `docs/inbound.md`, `docs/outbound.md`, and `docs/public-api.md`.
- Pi integration uses public hooks and APIs. A Telegram `/new` or equivalent session replacement requires a public Pi API that executes the real terminal path.

## 7. Engineering Conventions

- Keep comments and user-facing docs in English. Comment non-obvious rationale/contracts, not names or standard idioms.
- Name flat modules by bare domain (`queue.ts`, `queue.test.ts`); `telegram-api.ts` is the intentional transport exception. Tests primarily protect their mirrored module; shared fixtures require real cross-suite reuse.
- Keep interfaces consistent with their owning exported contract. Use local structural `*Like`/view types only for deliberate narrow projections, not duplicate source-of-truth models.
- Remove dead code immediately. Reachability from composition roots, public exports, tests, registered surfaces, and documented APIs—not recent usefulness—determines whether code is live.
- Treat every meaningful `index.ts` edit as a composition-pressure check, but keep one-off live adapter wiring there when extraction would only hide cross-domain state.
- Follow [`docs/ui-style.md`](./docs/ui-style.md) for interface copy, emoji, buttons, menus, and dialogs. Update the registry before assigning a new UI emoji meaning. Standalone notices use one fully bold emoji-led sentence with a terminal period; menu or chooser headings use the same hierarchy with a terminal colon. Material names may add nested italic emphasis without breaking the outer bold span. Callback alerts preserve equivalent emoji-led plain text because Telegram does not support rich formatting there.
- Markdown tables use compact source formatting with `---` separator cells and one surrounding space per cell. Preserve vendored references unchanged.
- Treat Windows filesystem, named-pipe, lock, heartbeat, and atomic-rename reports as high-signal evidence; reduce them to regressions or explicit platform caveats.
- Route significant runtime failures through the redacted recent-event recorder. Keep the compact TUI status at generic `error`; details belong in diagnostics.

## 8. Work Protocol

Before non-trivial work:

1. Read `README.md` for current product behavior and positioning.
2. Read `BACKLOG.md` before runtime or documentation changes.
3. Read the relevant indexed docs; read `docs/architecture.md` before architecture, queue, preview, rendering, lifecycle, or command restructuring.
4. Inspect the owning module, its callers, mirrored tests, and the relevant `index.ts` wiring before editing.
5. Run an `AGENTS.md` compliance pass for implementation, release, and architecture work; update an obsolete rule instead of silently working around it.

While working:

- Keep changes inside this repository; updating an installed Pi checkout is a separate operator action.
- Read large artifacts search-first and range-bounded. For `CHANGELOG.md`, inspect only the current release section unless older history is relevant.
- Keep successful validation output compact; inspect focused failure tails. Prefer focused tests/typecheck during iteration and broad validation at a stable gate.
- Preserve unrelated work and do not commit, publish, tag, deploy, or perform external actions without explicit authorization.

Before completion:

- Run the smallest decisive validation for the affected closure. Queue/rendering/lifecycle changes normally require `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` at the stable gate.
- For Domain DAG changes, run `SKILL_DIR=.agents/skills/domain-dag bash .agents/skills/domain-dag/scripts/validate-domain-dag.sh --root .`.
- Keep strict unused-local/parameter checking. Validate queue dispatch around abort, compaction, pending dispatch, and Pi pending-message guards; validate rendering around literal code, nesting, and long-message chunks.
- When context files change, run the ABCd context validator and review warnings rather than relying on exit status alone.
- Sync `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, and relevant `/docs` only when behavior, shipped impact, open-work truth, or durable contracts actually changed.
- Do not call a release ready until its canonical backlog gates and required platform/live evidence are complete.
